# Climate Change Language Shift
## Project Description
This repository will include all of the data I use, a Jupyter Notebook, the final poster that summarizes the project, as well as any other files relevant to my project. 

With this project, I will be analyzing how the the language used to discuss climate change has shifted from 1980-2010, by identifying key themes and patterns in each decade (1980-1990, 1990-2000, 2000-2010). As climate change becomes an increasingly pressing issue, it will be interesting to see how the language has followed this trend. Other key questions I will be answering include if the climate change discussion has become more popular, if there has been a shift in tone and themes, whether climate change was misunderstood in the past, etc. The more we look at how language shapes and develops on important issues like these over time, the more we can understand how it affects our policies and beliefs. 



## Poster
Here, I have linked my [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13ysMLgDCX0QncSGDZYKAKYJUUYGlDcqT/view?usp=sharing) that summarizes the scope, methods, interpretations, and conclusions of the project.

Below are some key visualizations included within the poster:
