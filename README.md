# Climate Change Language Shift
## Project Description
With this project, I will be analyzing how the the language used to discuss climate change has shifted from 1980-2010, by identifying key themes and patterns in each decade (1980-1990, 1990-2000, 2000-2010). As climate change becomes an increasingly pressing issue, it will be interesting to see how the language has followed this trend. Other key questions I will be answering include if the climate change discussion has become more popular, if there has been a shift in tone and themes, whether climate change was misunderstood in the past, etc. This repository will include all of the data I use, a Jupyter Notebook, the final poster that summarizes the project, as well as any other files relevant to my project. 
#Storyboard
Here, I have linked my [storyboard](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/invitations/accept/inv_43450962-7704-4bf3-87a8-8181195dbbeb) that summarizes the overall scope and method of the project.
