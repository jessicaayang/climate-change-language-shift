1980s,"Climatologists say that it may be several decades before we can detect, through the statistical ''noise'' of normal fluctuations, carbon dioxide-induced climate changes. Such changes are likely to be incremental and barely perceptible from year to year. Energy experts remind us that historically it has required 50 years to switch from one energy source to another. The future is unknowable: Wars or random and unimaginable events may upset carefully plotted predictions. Given scientific uncertainties, long lags required for proof or prevention, and public-policy overload, carbon dioxideinduced climate change may be an issue that politicans choose to ignore.

The population of Earth is likely to double in 50 years, and there will be growing demands for food, water, fuel, and natural resources. Climate change would be an added burden on severely strained social and economic systems. If the change brought a permanent drought, for example, to regions near the limit of their agricultural productivity, famine or migration could result.

There is no global policy of mutually assured survival. Natural disasters have the severest impact on poor people in poor countries. Highly developed countries are affected mainly in economic ways. Their complex infratructures are brittle but their institutional and human resources enable them to cope. Rich countries also have the greatest potential to exploit any favorable change in climate or possible benefits such as the use of carbon dioxide as a free fertilizer.

Even if there were no critical gaps in the data, implementing a global carbon-dioxide policy would still be difficult. The current uncertainties are not likely to be quickly resolved, but uncertainty does not relieve us of the burden of decision. Are there reasonable and prudent actions that buy time or protection? I think there are.

The issue cannot be safely ignored in setting energy and naturalresource policies, but it probably will be. We do not know enough to say what what amount of increase of carbon dioxide is safe, and would be unsuccessful if we tried to enforce any such global limit. By the time we were certain that a carbon dioxide-induced climate change was occurring, it would be too late to prevent it.","Analysis of the effects of a warmer and drier climate on rain-fed agriculture in the United States suggests that over the next couple of decades negative effects of climate change and positive effects from CO2 fertilization both will be modest and will approximately balance. The outlook is more troubling for agriculture in lands dependent on irrigation. Longer-term impacts are highly uncertain and will depend strongly on the outcome of future agricultural research, development and technology.

Changes in temperature and rainfall may be amplified as changes in the annual discharge of rivers. For example, a 2 degree centigrade warming could severely reduce the quantity and quality of water resources in the Western United States.

If a global warming of about 3 or 4 degree centigrade were to occur over the next hundred years, it is likely that there would be a global sea-level rise of about 60 centimeters, in comparison with the rise of about 15 centimeters over the last century. More rapid rates could occur subsequently, if the West Antarctic Ice Sheet should begin to disintegrate. Changes in Arctic Cover

Such a warming might also bring about changes in Arctic ice cover, with perhaps a disappearance of the summer ice pack and associated changes in high-latitude weather and climate.

Because of their large uncertainties and significant implications, it is important to confirm the various predictions of climate changes at the earliest possible time and to achieve greater precision. This can best be done through carefully designed monitoring programs of long duration emphasizing the ensemble of variables believed to influence climate or to reflect strongly the effect of CO2.

The social and economic implications of even the most carefully constructed and detailed scenarios of CO2 increase and climatic consequences are largely unpredictable. However, a number of inferences seem clear:

Rapid climate change will take its place among the numerous other changes that will influence the course of society, and these other changes may largely determine whether the climatic impacts of greenhouse gases are a serious problem.

As a human experience, climate change is far from novel; large numbers of people now live in almost all climatic zones and move easily between them.","A cloud of volcanic debris stretching 13,000 miles across two oceans has the potential to alter the earth's climate, atmospheric scientists say.

The cloud, more than 13 miles high, appears on satellite pictures as a gray-white haze and has already reduced sunlight over Hawaii.

Brian Toon of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research Center near San Francisco, says it far surpasses in size, height and density the ''mystery cloud'' of debris that appeared in January.

He said temperatures could dip on some areas of the earth because the cloud would filter sunlight, but that temperatures in other parts might rise because the cloud could prevent the earth's heat from dissipating.","In his announcement, Dr. Sovern cited radical climate changes of the past, such as the warm period when Vikings colonized the American Arctic and the subsequent chill that led to widespread famine. He noted fears that future warming could melt enough polar ice to flood worldwide coastal plains.

Dr. Barry Raleigh, who heads the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, noted the predicted climate- warming role of carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere by fuel combustion. The possible effects ''stagger the imagination,'' he said. Yet, he added, there is ''far too little evidence regarding magnitude of the effect.''

Alan D. Hecht, director of the National Climate Program Office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, noted the most recent problem facing climate specialists: the sudden drop in temperature resulting from a loss of sunlight that some specialists believe would follow nuclear attacks on cities. A national plan is being developed to assess the threat of such a ''nuclear winter,'' he added.

Climate trends are being studied at a number of institutions, but none are attacking the problem on such a broad front, Mr. Hecht said. They tend to focus primarily on the oceans or the atmosphere. The new center will have access to the Lamont observatory's 18,000 cores, or cross sections of sediment, extracted from the floors of all oceans and holding a record of climate over the past 140 million years.

Its link to Goddard will provide access to the space agency's powerful computers and its vast archives of observations from space.","A researcher at the University of Florida, studying the evolutionary history of a Jamaican land snail, has found that their shells can reveal climatic conditions of eons long past. Glenn Goodfriend, a doctoral candidate in zoology, found that the size of the fossilized shells reflected the moisture conditions they lived in.

The wetter the climate was, the larger their shells grew.

The discovery of shell deposits dating more than 60,000 years has enabled Mr. Goodfriend to trace some climatic changes along the north coast of Jamaica. The shells of two different species found in the deposits were larger than live snails of the same species in the same place today. Several other species in the deposits are not now found on the coast, but are limited to the moister interior.

Mr. Goodfriend says the findings indicate that during historical times it was wetter in Jamaica than it is now. But at other times, such as during the glaciations of the Pleistocene era, much of the tropics was cooler and drier, and tropical rain forests were restricted to small areas. Some snails that have lived in the same location all the while left smaller shells 40,000 and 70,000 years ago than they have today, indicating that the prevailing climate was drier then than now.

In addition to the information that snail shells can provide about past weather conditions, Mr. Goodfriend believes, further study of the relation between snail morphology and climate changes can help explain how changing climate and terrain can influence the formation of new species.","Despite widespread hardships caused by recent droughts, and despite predictions of radical climate changes, there is growing evidence that the climate of the United States has been relatively stable for the last four centuries.

This evidence is seen by many climatologists as an indication that no great change is likely in the near future. But within those normal limits there is inevitable drought. Because agriculture has become so vulnerable to severe dry spells, scientists are urgently seeking to better understand the history and causes of climate change, how it will vary in the future and what might be done to cope with drought. While many believe no drastic change is imminent, there is much disagreement over what is likely in the next century and beyond.

Perhaps the most pessimistic recent climate prediction was made in 1974 in a secret report circulated in the Central Intelligence Agency. The report said the world was returning to the climate that existed over the 400 years before 1850, ''an era of drought, famine and political unrest in the Western world.'' Warning System Sought

It said the agency should develop the ability ''to forewarn us of the economic and political collapse of nations caused by worldwide failures in food production.'' Furthermore, it added that it was necessary to ''assess a nation's propensity to initiate militarily large-scale migrations of their people.''","Gases Trap Infrared Radiation

Scientists have warned that carbon dioxide, from the burning of fossil fuels, and other man-made gases, such as methane and chlorofluorocarbons, are accumulating in the atmosphere. These gases trap in the earth's atmosphere solar infrared radiation that would otherwise escape back into space. Projections based on mathematical models indicate the average temperature at the surface of the earth, starting by the end of this century, could increase by as much as 9 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100.

Because the rise in temperature is expected to be higher at the earth's poles, another effect of the climate change is expected to be a melting of the icecaps and a rise in the level of the oceans of seven feet or more.

A recent meeting of world scientists in Villach, Austria, confirmed these projections and reached a consensus that their impact would be felt sooner rather than later.

At the hearing today, scientists warned of possibly catastrophic consequences if the problem was not addressed.

Dr. Syukuro Manabe of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration presented findings indicating that the great food-producing regions of North America, the Soviet Union and Western Europe could be subject to a gradual drying trend that could turn them into dust bowls.","Mankind's activities in increasing the amount of carbon dioxide and other chemicals in the atmosphere can be expected to have a substantial warming effect on climate, with the first clear signs of the trend becoming evident within this decade, a scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said here today.

The changes are in prospect because of excess carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere as humans burn coal, gas, oil and wood and cut forests for agriculture and other purposes. More recently there has also been an atmospheric buildup of methane, nitrous oxide and other chemicals as a result of agriculture and industry, said Dr. James Hansen of the space agency's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.

Dr. Hansen spoke at a session of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science here and amplified some of his remarks at a news conference.

Several recent studies have concluded that such a warming trend will occur, but the effects have usually been predicted for the next century and have been interpreted differently by specialists. Dr. Roger Revelle of the University of California at San Diego said the subject of future climate change produced by mankind's activity was shrouded by a fog of uncertainty.","Core Radius Is 2,190 Miles

The core radius is 2,190 miles, but only an outer layer 60 miles thick is thought to alter the earth's spin rate. The inner zone, half the radius, is solid. It is assumed that the magnetic field of the earth is generated by a combination of rotation and heat-generated churning within the entire liquid region of the core, rather than just the top layer.

At the earth's surface the resulting magnetic field is much like that of a bar magnet. Thus, at the north and south magnetic poles the force lines are vertical; midway between them the force is horizontal. The field is also slightly asymmetrical, with abnormal intensity over eastern Brazil.

Ever since the 17th century it has been known that the field drifts westward at a rate of a few miles each year. As explained recently by Camille Gire of the French group, it is assumed that this occurs because the core is rotating eastward slightly slower than is the outer solid part of the earth.

The lag amounts to a mile or more each year. Changes in core circulation also cause slow migrations of the two magnetic poles. Navigation charts give the estimated yearly variation in magnetic direction, but it is subject to a variety of influences.

North Magnetic Pole Move

Since 1973, for example, the North Magnetic Pole has moved north 70 miles from the south end of Bathurst Island in the Canadian Archipelago to the north of that island. In the past 30 years the South Magnetic Pole has migrated 185 miles from the interior of Antarctica to a point at sea off the French station Dumont D'Urville.

The earth's magnetism is also subject to short-term changes linked to solar eruptions. The significance of the 1969 ''jerk'' has been debated for several years. Skeptics argued that since it was most clearly and uniformly evident in the eastern component of the earth's magnetism as recorded by European observatories, it might have been a local effect.

Others who, like the group here, regard it of global significance, note that Europe has by far the densest and longest-standing network of magnetic observatories and therefore has produced the most persuasive data.","Full text is unavailable for this digitized archive article.

In a report to the National Science Foundation, the specialists propose that the use of fossil fuel, largely responsible for the carbon dioxide increase, can be substantially reduced by greater efficiency in energy production.

They believe that energy use could be cut in half within 50 years.

Reduced burning of fossil fuels can also be achieved by speeding up conversions to nuclear power, solar energy and wind power, says their analysis.

In many parts of the world, it asserts, nuclear power is significantly cheaper than coal, ''especially given environmental restrictions against coal typical of present United States practices.''","Plans for meeting future energy needs should consider the danger that use of fossil fuels may lead to higher temperatures and a worldwide climate change, the National Research Council said today.

The council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, reaffirmed its 1979 warning about the hazards of increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels.

The report said it was likely that a doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide in the air, which could occur by the middle of the next century, would raise the world's temperature by 2.7 degrees to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.5 degrees to 4.5 degrees Celsius.

This result is known as the greenhouse effect because, like a greenhouse, carbon dioxide allows solar energy to enter the earth's atmosphere as light, then traps it as heat. Increased Cloudiness Seen","What can we really say about future climate? There are three ways of making climate predictions. The first is through theory.

Theory says that increasing the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide may lead to warming. Because the concentration of carbon dioxide is increasing, we worry about warming. Beyond that, we do not know enough about climate processes to make useful predictions from theory alone.

The second way of making climate predictions is through computer models. These models are large systems of equations representing our understanding of climate processes. Because our understanding is limited, the models are of limited use. For example, these models have a hard time reproducing current climate from current data. They cannot be expected to predict future climate with any precision.

The third way of making climate predictions is by using existing data. Although this is the crudest way -the past being a potentially poor guide to the future - existing data can, for example, tell us if the greenhouse effect has already begun. Temperature data for the last 120 years show an irregular warming of about 1 degree Fahrenheit over the past century. Over some periods, this warming was relatively rapid. The 1980's has been such a period, as were the 1890's and 1920's.

Because the greenhouse effect is associated with warming, and the data show warming, can we conclude that the greenhouse effect has begun? Not unless we are prepared to believe that the only cause of warming is the greenhouse effect. There are indications that the current warming is unrelated to the greenhouse effect. The rate of warming is far below that predicted under the greenhouse effect.","AFTER decades of neglect, environmental issues are moving from the periphery of geopolitics toward center stage. Several recent events demonstrate that the superpowers and other nations are starting to address problems like the greenhouse effect, acid rain and the thinning of the ozone shield with some of the same seriousness once reserved for international security and economic affairs.

''We are seeing a greening of geopolitics,'' said Rafe Pomerance of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based research and policy group. Frederick M. Bernthal, the Assistant Secretary of State who handles environmental matters, said that issues like global climate change and the ozone hole over the Antarctic are producing a growing ''international consensus on viewing the planet as a single ecosystem.''

These kinds of concerns, Mr. Bernthal said, ''used to be the backwater of diplomacy.'' Because of the dawning recognition that air pollution does not respect national boundaries and that the destruction of tropical forests threatens the ecological health of the entire world, environmental issues once relegated to low-level bureaucrats are now appearing on the agendas of summit meetings.

Secretary of State George P. Shultz recently spent an hour discussing global warming with a State Department advisory group, Mr. Bernthal noted. ''That indicates the level of attention that issue is now getting,'' he said. If scientists confirm that the earth is warming rapidly because of industrial gases accumulating in the atmosphere, he said, ''The potential is there for this to become a major if not the major issue in the 21st century.'' Third World Polluters","The average cow belches up to 400 liters of methane a day, a situation that worsens the global greenhouse effect and ought to be curbed, a Colorado State University scientist says.

The greenhouse warming of the Earth's atmosphere is caused mainly by carbon dioxide in the air, much of it generated by the burning of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide traps solar energy and raises global temperatures.

But scientists have recently discovered that methane, commonly produced by fermenting vegetation, also contributes strongly to climatic warming. A large share of the methane released into the atmosphere comes from the chemical degradation of cellulose in the guts of termites, rodents, ungulates and other eaters of wood and straw.

The methane molecule, consisting of one atom of carbon and four of hydrogen, is produced in environments where no oxygen is available, as in the rumens of cattle. The rumen is a separate compartment of a cow's stomach, where cellulose is broken down by symbiotic bacteria into digestible cud and methane gas.","Dr. Hansen, a leading expert on climate, said earlier this year that global temperature readings in the first months of the year suggested that 1988 could be the hottest year on record. Today he said that, because of a cooling trend in the South Pacific caused by a shifting of the El Nino current, 1988 might not end up as the hottest year after all.

The loss of atmospheric ozone this year is less than half of what it was in 1987, said Dr. Robert Watson of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. But he insisted that these findings did not change the conclusion that chlorofluorocarbons and other industrial chemicals are destroying the earth's protective ozone shield.

In a review of findings disclosed earlier this fall, Dr. Watson referred to observations by Dr. Mark Schoerberl of the space agency that there was a 15 percent depletion of ozone over the Antarctic this year, as against 50 percent observed last October.

At a news conference after the morning session of the climate meeting, Dr. Watson explained the atmosphere over Antarctica was more disturbed this year so that the vortex of still air from which so much ozone was disturbed last year was ''less tight.'' He also said there were fewer clouds over the Antarctic this year and thus less cloud crystal surface on which the chemical reactions that cause the destruction of ozone molecules can take place. But the fact that the seasonal depletion of ozone in Antarctica is not as great this year should not lead to the conclusion that the ozone layer is not being depleted, Dr. Watson cautioned.

Ozone in the upper atmosphere shields the earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Dr. John S. Hoffman, director of the global change program at the Environmental Protection Agency, said that data collected by the agency indicated that for every 1 percent depletion of atmospheric ozone, there would be a 40 percent increase in deaths from skin cancer in the United States alone. While skin cancer from increased radiation would chiefly affect light-skinned people, the radiation would also cause a greatly increased incidence of eye cataracts among all races, Dr. Hoffman said.","The report, prepared by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory and the Brookhaven National Laboratory, said carbon dioxide pollution could be cut by 40 to 50 percent through aggressive measures to use fossil fuels more efficiently. One measure mentioned by the report is tougher fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles.

Donna R. Fitzpatrick, Energy Under Secretary, said in a telephone interview that while global warming remained an unproven theory, ''we ought to be pursuing energy efficiency gains anyway'' because it made sense for other reasons, including reducing dependence on foreign fuel.

While the trend is beginning to take root, it is too soon to tell how it will fare under President-elect Bush. He has called the global warming problem a serious issue that he intends to address in his first year in office, but he has not discussed the issue of energy conservation in any detail. Major World Effort Vowed

William A. Nitze, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for environment, health and natural resources, said today that at an international conference set for 1990 the United States was likely to propose a major world effort to use fuel more efficiently. That meeting, to be held to prepare an agreement on global warming, will be under the auspices of the United Nations Environmental Program.

Mr. Nitze was part of the United States delegation at a meeting in Geneva this month to plan for the 1990 conference. At that meeting the United States was given the leadership of the committee for planning ways to reduce carbon dioxide and other gases. Mr. Nitze said the committee would be considering ''the obvious candidates.'' These include shifting to other energy sources, including nuclear power, over the long run.","As the global sea levels rise by one to three feet or more because of thermal expansion of the oceans and the melting of glaciers, most of the nation's coastal marshes and swamps would be inundated by salt water. Louisiana, which has 40 percent of the nation's coastal wetlands, could lose up to 85 percent of these rich ecological habitats.

Beaches and other developed coastlines could be protected by dredging and other means, but the cost would be high, as much as $111 billion through the year 2100. Even with these efforts, some 7,000 square miles of coastal drylands, an area the size of Massachusetts, could be lost.

While changes in rainfall patterns cannot yet be predicted with accuracy, the warming trend is likely to produce changes in water quantity and quality in some areas. In California, for example, an earlier snowmelt and runoff could disrupt water management systems and mean that less water will be available in the drier months of late summer. Reduced snow and faster evaporation may reduce the level of the Great Lakes. Where there is less water there would be less dilution of pollutants. Higher temperatures could increase the growth of algae that would choke out other life in some lakes.

Summer heat waves may lead to an increasing number of deaths, particularly among the elderly. This trend would be pronounced in northern states, where prolonged heat is now unusual. Diseases borne by insects, including malaria and Rocky Mountain spotted fever could spread as warmer weather expanded the range of the insects. Diseases exacerbated by air pollution, such as asthma and emphysema, are likely to be increasingly troublesome. Because hotter weather is likely to increase pollution.

''On a national scale, the supply of agricultural commodities does not appear to be be threatened by climate change,'' the report stated. The projections showed that while crop acreage in Appalachia, the Southeast and the southern Great Plains could decrease by 5 to 25 percent, acreage in the northern Great Plains, the northern Great Lakes states and the Pacific Northwest would increase by 5 to 17 percent. The growing amount of carbon dioxide in the air could actually increase the yield of some crops because carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants in photosynthesis. Rise in Food Prices

Many of the nation's farmers might respond to climate changes by increasing irrigation or shifting to crops that thrive in drier soils. Food prices are likely to increase to the detriment of consumers but the benefit of food producers.

Some regions are likely to suffer more than others, the report noted. The Southeast, which would lose major lowland areas and already suffers from high temperatures in summer, is one region that would feel the effects of global warming heavily. California, which already has problems making do on its available water, would also have difficulty in adjusting to the climate changes.

Next month, governments of industrial and developing countries are scheduled to meet in Geneva under the sponsorship of the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization to set up panels to examine the predicted effects of global warming and to recommend strategies for dealing with the expected changes. The findings of the E.P.A. report are likely be considered at that meeting.","The nuclear industry, which has has seen the cancellation of every plant ordered after 1974, sees a silver lining in the greenhouse cloud. The business has been atrophied for so long that no designs are on the shelf. But the industry is working toward a more polished version of the plants ordered in the early 70's, with standardized, more ''user friendly'' designs and refinements to allow faster, more economical construction.

In the long run, reactor builders would like a different design, one that would not require the proper functioning of pipes, valves and pumps to prevent accidents. The industry insists that those components are reliable and cites ''probabilistic risk assessments'' showing risks so small that they are expressed in exponential notation instead of ordinary numbers. But that is no longer the point.

''Clearly, the public does not accept the probabilistic risk numbers,'' said Dr. Richard J. Slember, vice president and general manager of the energy systems unit at Westinghouse Electric Corporation. ''They just don't understand them.''

Officials at Westinghouse, which designs the water-based reactors, also point out the benefits of simply standardizing technology, instead of using a different prototype for each plant. The cost for a standardized plant, Dr. Slember said, would be under $1,500 a kilowatt of capacity. (In contrast, the Shoreham plant, on Long Island, cost more than $5,000 a kilowatt.) But environmentalists point out that Shoreham, now the only major utility construction project in New York State, is only 810 megawatts, and growth in the state last year was 704 megawatts. At that rate, a new plant the size of Shoreham would be needed almost every year just to keep up with demand.

Mr. Komanoff calculated that for nuclear power to cut the use of fossil fuels around the world by half, the rate of completion of nuclear plants would have to rise to 16 a week between 1995 and 2020.

Meanwhile, environmentalists say, there is room for efficiency improvement. The United States used 56 tons of oil (or its equivalent in coal or natural gas) per $1,000 of production last year, while Switzerland did the same job with 34 tons, and Japan and Italy with 28 tons, according to the International Energy Agency. Environmentalists say that the United States could double effiency by using the technology now employed in Japan - which has done everything from modernizing industrial plants to relying more heavily on mass transit and striving for ever-higher gasoline mileage and ever more efficient home appliances.

Mr. Komanoff figured that to cut fossil fuel use by half, world efficiency would have to rise 4.6 percent a year, ''60 percent faster than the rate of efficiency improvement in the U.S. during 1978-86, and 35 percent faster than efficiency was improved in Japan in the same period.''","VIRTUALLY all the carbon dioxide emitted by power plants to be built in the next decade could be absorbed by 10 million acres of new forest, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. The organization has proposed that such planting be undertaken by the Federal Conservation Reserve Program, a project of the Department of Agriculture.

The trees would absorb as much carbon dioxide as would be produced by the burning of fossil fuels in the power plants. The gas collects in the atmosphere, where it traps heat like the glass in a greenhouse. Many scientists believe this ''greenhouse effect'' is contributing to global warming.

Daniel J. Dudek, author of the proposal, described it yesterday to the Senate Energy Committee, which began two days of hearings on the role of forests in controlling carbon dioxide in the air.

Discussing the role of trees in soaking up and storing carbon dioxide, Senator Timothy E. Wirth, the Colorado Democrat who is chairman of the committee, said yesterday that about 27 million acres of tropical rain forests are being destroyed each year. Combustion or rotting of this forest material puts even more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.","A. James Wagner, an analyst at the Weather Service, acknowledges that during this decade the world has seen the four warmest years of the past century - 1980, 1983, 1986 and 1987. ''But I don't feel that the evidence is overpowering that this is anything more than a normal fluctuation,'' he said.

Climatologists constantly invent and refine mathematical models in an attempt to understand fluctuations. One such model, which seems to mimic the real climate quite realistically, was devised by Dr. Edward Lorenz of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This model, which does not take carbon dioxide into account but does reckon on the interactions of the atmosphere with the ocean, exhibits large variations.

''The Lorenz model was run backward on a computer for the equivalent of about 400 years,'' Mr. Wagner said, ''and the large fluctuations it sometimes produced, which were not entirely random but which were not cyclical either, were quite startling.''

The swings, he said, were as much as plus or minus 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit in global temperature from one year to the next. The model sometimes produced clusters, in which several years close together were unusually hot - a pattern imitating the real climate of the 1980's.

Frederick J. Gadomsky, a member of a team of climate experts at Pennsylvania State University, believes that the summer now ending, warm though it may have been in North America, did not bear out theoretical predictions based on the greenhouse effect.

''From a global greenhouse warming,'' he said, ''one would expect regional warming to show up first in the polar regions rather than, say, in North Dakota. But this has not been the case.''

There is a possibility, experts say, that the earth has self-corrective mechanisms that tend to stabilize the climate, even when carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, such as methane, are added. Much of the infrared radiation from the sun is ordinarily reflected back into space by clouds, the oceans and the ground, but greenhouse gases absorb some of that energy, preventing its escape. The greenhouse molecules, thereby heated, are dispersed throughout the atmosphere and warm it.","The two criteria that have determined the choice of fossil fuels for more than a century are price and availability. The new standard would be how much carbon dioxide a fuel produces. For the amount of heat that results in four pounds of carbon dioxide when coal is used, oil would produce only three pounds and natural gas, two.

Switching to fuels that produce less carbon dioxide would require huge dislocation. The Shell Oil Company, for example, estimates that in 1987, total world energy production of hydrocarbon fuels was the equivalent of 135 million barrels of oil a day. Of that amount, 32 percent was coal, 45 percent was oil and only 23 percent was natural gas, the best of the lot.

Shifts are possible, but they would create new strategic problems. The United States has enough coal to last more than 300 years, but there are just a few decades' worth of gas reserves at current rates of consumption. While there is more gas to be discovered, the total would still be a small fraction of the coal supply.

At the moment, some utilities are interested in gas, especially for a new generation of power plants that produces more electricity and useful steam from a given quantity of fuel. Over all, however, energy users have considered natural gas unattractive because of questions about availability and whether the price will remain competitive in years to come. Demand is low and production has fallen by more than 25 percent since the early 1970's; recently natural gas has lost market share to cheaper oil. And coal is far cheaper than either.

The biggest users of coal - and therefore, perhaps, the biggest greenhouse targets - are the electric utilities. American utilities alone contribute 7.5 percent of the world's carbon dioxide output, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif. If the utilities could curb their carbon dioxide production, the benefits would be twofold. Their own electricity would be ''cleaner,'' and more electricity could be used to heat homes and run factories, replacing fossil fuels burned in boilers and furnaces. With a few advances in battery technology and provisions for easy recharging, electricity could begin to replace gasoline to power cars.

But producing ''clean'' electricity now is not practical. The utilities have already spent billions of dollars to install equipment to capture the sulfur dioxide created by their plants that is linked to acid rain. In theory, they could install equipment to capture carbon dioxide, as well. The cost would be staggering, however.

A study earlier this year by the Brookhaven National Laboratory, commissioned by the Department of Energy, estimated that the capital cost of installing the technology would be 70 to 150 percent of the cost of the original plant. The average cost of electricity itself, the study estimated, would rise 75 percent. And there are equally daunting concerns about storing the millions of tons of carbon dioxide gas that would be captured each year.","Like glass in a greenhouse, these gases are transparent to incoming sunlight, but they absorb heat radiated from the ground and prevent it from escaping into space.

He held up one die representing the climate for the period 1950-1980. Two sides were white for an average summer, and two other sides were blue for colder-than-average summers. The other two sides were red for hotter-than-average summers. Thus, on a roll of the die for that period, there were two chances in six of having a hot summer at any given location in the country.

Then Dr. Hansen picked up the die for the 1990's and explained:

''If our climate model calculations are approximately correct, the greenhouse warming in the 1990's will be sufficient to shift the probabilities such that the chance of a hot summer in most of the country will be in the range of 55 to 80 percent. Four sides of the die are red. I believe it is obvious that the man in the street will notice that by then the dice are loaded. There will be more hot summers than normal, and the hottest ones will be hotter than they used to be.'' Support in Congress

Dr. Hansen's message, a mix of data-based analysis and plain-spoken conviction, has had a stunning impact on political thinking, say experts on the environment and public policy. Bipartisan support is growing in Congress to increase financing for climate research and to consider legislation aimed at controlling the introduction of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

At a 46-nation Conference on the Changing Atmosphere in Toronto shortly after Dr. Hansen's testimony, scientists and policy makers urged development of energy consumption policies that would drastically reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing at an annual rate of one-half a percent because of the burning of fossil fuels - oil, gas and especially coal - and the destruction of tropical forests.","One futuristic idea is to use giant lasers atop mountains to scrub harmful chemicals from the earth's atmosphere, a concept pioneered by Dr. Stix at Princeton. He calls it ''atmospheric processing.'' His lasers would be aimed at industrial chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, which are used mainly in refrigerants and in the manufacture of plastic foams. Once released in the air, they rise high into the stratosphere where they destroy protective ozone. Stratospheric ozone helps block ultraviolet light, which can cause skin cancer and eye damage and harm natural systems. Array of Infrared Lasers

The laser system would break apart CFC's in the lower atmosphere before they had a chance to damage the ozone layer. The concentrated light would be tuned to a frequency most easily absorbed by CFC's, which is in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Dr. Stix calculates that an array of infrared lasers around the world could blast apart as one million tons of CFC a year, equal to the current annual flow into the atmosphere.

In terms of feasibility, Dr. Stix said: ''Some of the answers are known. Many aren't. A major question is whether you can get the laser's energy absorbed by CFC's and not other molecules, such as water vapor or carbon dioxide.''

Another issue, he added, is to what extent the general atmosphere would absorb laser energy, limiting propagation of the beam. Plans to Replace Ozone

A less exotic cure for ozone depletion would be to simply replace it. Experts have proposed that bulk ozone be produced on earth and lofted into the stratosphere in rockets, aircraft or balloons. Other ideas include firing aloft ''bullets'' of frozen ozone, or placing solar-powered ozone generators in high-altitude balloons. Since ozone consists of three oxygen atoms, and atmospheric oxygen has two such atoms, raw material would be plentiful.

Leon Y. Sadler, a chemical engineer at the University of Alabama, writing recently in Chemical and Engineering News, proposed using a fleet of jets to dispense ozone. His calculations showed that the number of planes needed to replenish of the ozone would be equivalent to less than 2 percent of the aircraft that haul freight in the United States.

But other scientists have calculated that the job would be many times larger. ''Ozone replacement would be a really massive, massive thing to do,'' said Michael C. MacCracken, head of atmospheric sciences at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California For now, all scientists stress the importance of reducing emission of ozone-destroying chemicals, as called for in a recent treaty.","The cold war isn't over. But even as the political climate is warming, so is the world's physical climate. There are many signs that the next general international crisis is going to be about the environment. It can become as abrasive, dangerous and costly as the arms race.

There have been warnings about environmental abuse for decades, but concerns were separated from high politics and security. Now convergence has begun. Environment is changing from a noble, usually local cause to an international political issue that can be seen gathering force. It is already a major domestic issue in a few countries, notably West Germany.

The key difficulty at this stage is that there are so many different aspects of the problem and no overall approach. Nobody really knows how various causes and effects fit together, and how to assign responsibility. There has been much talk about the greenhouse effect, ozone depletion, acid rain and toxic wastes, not to mention nuclear accidents. But the nations have yet to develop a concept of coordination.

For example, the Inter-Action Council, a group of eminent former government leaders, recently recommended a new look at nuclear energy. They concluded that accumulating atmospheric deterioration caused by burning ever more coal and oil is more dangerous than expanded use of nuclear energy under proper safety rules."
1990s,"But the research going on in the Alps is crucial, Mr. Haeberli said, because this is where glacier studies first began more than a century ago. Austria, France and Switzerland began studying glaciers to monitor the water running off these enormous frozen watertowers because of their powerful impact on the region's farming, shipping and hydroelectric dams.

Increasingly, though, glaciologists here and on other continents are expanding their observation network as interest in the environment has surged and more scientists try to understand the planet's complex weather systems. American spy satellites, released from cold war duty, are joining in the monitoring of ice.

'The glaciers of the Alps are among the best indicators we have of a warming or cooling world,' said Mr. Haeberli. 'They are small and react quickly, they are accessible and they may be representative of what is happening in cold mountain regions in general. Here we have the oldest first-hand records available.'

Looking for the messages hidden in ice, researchers have been poring through the records of churches, villages and the military. They found accounts from the warmer Middle Ages, showing that people and animals passed easily across some mountain passes of the Alps that must have had less ice than today.

In the colder 17th and 18th centuries, Swiss village records noted farmers complaining that glaciers were destroying their fields and vineyards.

At one point, the people of Chamonix, below the Mont Blanc in France, worried so much about the expanding Mer de Glace glacier that they feared it might knock over the church. A painting of the Mont Blanc, dated 1740, shows the Mer de Glace reaching the edge of the village.

But since the mid-19th century, the Mer de Glace has retreated by almost a mile. And the biggest glacier of mainland Europe, the 13-mile-long Aletsch in Switzerland, has retreated more than one mile and lost more than 300 feet in thickness over the last century.","The 'best estimate' is about a third lower than that forecast five years ago, the group said, largely because the climatic effect of sulfate aerosols -- tiny droplets of sulfur emitted by industry that cool the atmosphere by reflecting sunlight -- has now been taken into account. In some regions, these aerosols more than offset the warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases.

Nevertheless, the predicted warming could cause widespread climatic disruption.

Yesterday's report, issued at a meeting in Madrid, emphasized that much uncertainty remains, not least scientists' inability to say whether human activity is responsible for a little of the warming to date or a lot. The uncertainty stems mainly from the imperfections of computer models of the atmosphere. Experts agree, for instance, that the models do not yet reflect the climate system's natural variability very well.

But the panel said the models have demonstrated 'increasing realism' and have 'increased our confidence in their use for projection of future climate change.'

Model studies of the warming trend have shown that it is 'unlikely to be entirely natural in origin,' the panel said. More convincing, it reported, are more recent studies that compare the highly idiosyncratic patterns of warming and cooling over recent decades with those that, according to the models, should be produced by the combined effect of increasing greenhouse gases and aerosols.

A correspondence has been found between what the models say should have occurred and the observed changes in temperature. The panel said the likelihood that the correspondence could occur by chance is 'very low.'","Scientists working in Brazil have found the first proof that undisturbed tropical rain forests soak up huge amounts of the carbon dioxide that people produce by burning fuels.

The measurements, published on Friday in the journal Science, show that each year, each hectare (2.47 acres) of the southwestern Amazon rain forest absorbs a ton of carbon dioxide.

Virgin forest sequesters carbon from the atmosphere,' wrote John Grace of the University of Edinburgh, who led a team of British, Australian and Brazilian ecologists. 'The whole of tropical South America may act as a carbon sink.'

If the measurements are extended globally, the world's remaining tracts of tropical rain forests could be absorbing a billion tons of carbon dioxide every year, one-sixth of the amount produced by burning fuels, said Pieter Tans of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.","The report comes at a time when 142 countries that are parties to the 1992 climate treaty signed in Rio de Janeiro are negotiating reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases. The emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil. The industrialized countries of the world have already pledged, as a first step, to cap the emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.

The report also comes as Republicans in Congress are seeking to reduce by as much as 40 percent the funds for the Clinton Administration's program to reach the 1990 cap.

The role of the intergovernmental panel, which consists of about 2,500 experts around the world, is to advise the treaty parties. An economics working group reported in Montreal 11 days ago that earlier action to cut emissions might relieve the burden on future generations by giving them more flexibility. The new report, from another working group, says that loss of this flexibility would force deeper emission cuts later on.

An average increase in global temperature of 1.5 to 6.3 degrees by the year 2100, predicted by a third working group, would cause a sea level rise of 6 to 37 inches by then and more in the following centuries, according to the report issued yesterday. Many low-lying coastal areas around the world could be inundated, the scientists say. An average rise of about 39 inches, they say, could place 70 million people at risk.

The panel also said climate change could produce, among other things, these consequences:

*Bring an increase in heat waves, floods, droughts, fires and pest outbreaks in some regions.

*Lead to the disappearance of entire forest types.","The modelers reply that these efficiencies cannot be achieved on the scale that Dr. Krause believes. 'We all agree there is some free lunch out there,' said Dr. Richard Richels, an economist at the Electric Power Research Institute, an organization in Palo Alto, Calif., that is supported by the power industry. 'What we don't agree on is how much.' Dr. Richels, an expert on modeling, is also an author of the intergovernmental panel's report. 'It's somewhat of a gamble as to who's right,' he said. 'Over time, we'll learn who's right.'

Another author of the panel's report, Dr. William R. Cline of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said that even if Dr. Krause was right, the early and relatively easy 'no regrets' reductions would represent a one-time windfall whose impact would not come close to solving the emissions problem in the long term.

Both Dr. Richels and Dr. Cline argue that the long-term view should prevail, and this raises perplexing issues as to the timing of emissions reductions. Too large a reduction now, Dr. Richels said, could work a financial hardship on the economy by forcing it to replace physical plant and equipment with new technologies prematurely.

The intergovernmental panel, in a draft report, said there would be at least two replacement cycles over the next century. Each would offer an opportunity to adopt alternative fuels and technologies like solar and wind power, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles, fuels made from wood or grain and nuclear power if safety concerns can be met. It makes economic sense, Dr. Richels argues, to use the cheaper fossil fuels now, while investing in the research and development that can bring down the cost of alternative fuels and technologies and make them more attractive in the next investment cycle.

Another point of contention has to do with the trade-offs involved in deciding whether to take stronger action sooner rather than later. Some economists say the only economically efficient course is to make very modest emissions reductions and to delay even those. Others say this merely delays effective action, thereby favoring the economic well-being of the present generation at the expense of future ones: today's consumers would behave like grasshoppers rather than ants.

Few analyses of the costs and benefits of dealing with climate change look more than a century ahead. But Dr. Cline said this was not far enough for a true reading. He said that if no emissions reductions were made, enough fossil fuel remained to allow atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations to rise for 300 years before mixing processes in the deep ocean started to stabilize them.

Placing a dollar value on the benefits of avoiding damage from climate change is an even more difficult exercise than calculating the costs. Some experts say that in some ways it may be impossible: what is the worth, for instance, of the culture of an ocean island destroyed by rising seas? Nevertheless, a number of attempts to calculate benefits have been made. The potential damages to be avoided include, for example, agricultural losses, damage to natural ecosystems, inundation by rising seas, higher cooling bills, human illness, displacement of populations and damages from extreme weather.","The latest research extends a study last May, also led by Mr. Karl, which concluded that from 1980 through 1994, the greenhouse effect increased the incidence of drought, above-normal temperatures, wintertime precipitation and heavy rainstorms in many areas of the United States.

As revealed in a draft report recently made available on the Internet, experts advising the world's governments are saying for the first time that at least some of the climate change being observed in the world is likely to have been caused by human activity like the burning of coal, oil and wood, which produces carbon dioxide. The draft report also predicts that an increase in the incidence of extreme weather events will accompany a rise in the average global temperature of 1.44 to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced.

According to the imperfect computerized models of the climate system on which the experts largely base their expectations, a warming climate could damp down short-term variations in temperature. In temperate zones, high and low temperatures in the summer normally vary less from one day to the next than in other seasons. The models predict that as the climate warms, the swings should generally become more summerlike.

This has indeed happened, Mr. Karl and his colleagues found by examining temperature records from hundreds of sites in China, the former Soviet Union and the United States over the last 30 to 80 years. In this respect, temperate regions are becoming somewhat more like the tropics, where the temperature is relatively constant year-round.

Temperature records were also examined for Australia, but no clear trend was found. Different atmospheric circulation patterns in the Southern Hemisphere may account for this, Mr. Karl said.","We appear to be veering off the target, and a gap now exists between our goals and what current actions and funding are likely to accomplish,' Stephen Seidel of the White House Council on Environmental Quality said on Friday at a hearing of the council, which is to decide by December whether to toughen its antipollution program.

Groups representing oil companies, electric utilities, automobile makers and others have said that mandatory steps would be too costly and that the current program's voluntary measures need more time to work. Partly in response to that program, scores of big corporations have embarked on energy-saving measures or undertaken efforts like the planting of trees, which help clean the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide.

But environmental groups say the voluntary measures neglect a principal and fast-growing source of greenhouse gases: the carbon dioxide emitted by cars burning gasoline.

Rather than require auto makers to increase the average efficiency of their cars, as Bill Clinton promised to do during his Presidential election campaign, the Administration last year convened a yearlong conference of environmentalists, car companies and others to seek a consensus on ways of cutting automobile pollution.

But the conference broke up this week without filing a report. That development followed a refusal by the oil companies and the car makers to go along with recommendations that included tougher fuel efficiency standards and financial incentives for consumers to buy efficient cars. A group representing a majority of the conference's participants will file a report, but the consensus that the Administration sought will be lacking.","The human contribution to global warming could range from highly significant to trivial. The scientists say it is not yet possible to measure how much of the warming has been caused by human activity and how much is a result of natural causes.

Computer models are the principal basis for the draft report's forecast that the world's average surface temperature will rise by about 1.5 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100 if no further action is taken to rein in greenhouse gas emissions. Further warming -- 50 to 70 percent more than what took place by 2100 -- would take place after that year, the report says. The warming would be somewhat larger if, as appears possible, industry stops emitting sulfate aerosols, which exert a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight and are air pollutants in their own right.

Even if atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases were stabilized immediately, the report says, the world would still warm by about 1 to 3.5 degrees, resulting in some degree of climatic dislocation.

The panel's draft report has yet to undergo review by governments but its members say they expect few if any substantial changes in the findings. Members of the panel said in interviews that there was a range of views among their group as to the impacts of the predicted warming. The draft reports, they said, represent a reconciliation of these views. They said further that in the case of agriculture, one competing school of thought held that farmers would adapt with new crops and methods, while another said that food production might plummet in some regions.

Sea-level rise is one of the clearer consequences expected of the predicted warming. Measurement of the rise is 'the dipstick of climate change' said Dr. Stephen P. Leatherman, director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at the University of Maryland and a reviewer of the panel's chapter on the subject.

Since its last full assessment in 1990, the panel has cut its estimate of expected average sea-level rise between now and 2100 from a 'best estimate' of 26 inches to a little less than 20 inches, with a possible range of 10 to 31 inches. A further rise is expected after 2100. The best estimate for 2100, the draft report says, would by then put at risk tens of millions of people in low-lying areas and on oceanic islands. Many low areas, like parts of the Maldives, Egypt and Bangladesh, would be inundated, and many of their inhabitants would be cast on the world's mercies as environmental refugees.

At present, the draft report says, an estimated 46 million people experience flooding because of storm surges each year. Under the best estimate for 2100, 92 million to 118 million would be so affected. Rich countries might be able to adapt, but at the cost of spending $521 million a year on sea walls and other protection, the panelists estimate. Even then, many coastal wetlands and sandy beaches would have to be sacrificed. Poorer countries would find it more difficult to protect themselves, the report says.","The evidence mounted last week that man-made gases are causing deterioration of the earth's atmosphere. First came news that a United Nations scientific panel believes it has found, for the first time, evidence that human activities are indeed causing a much-debated warming of the globe. The report, though preliminary, appeared to strengthen the case that governments throughout the world may need to take stronger action to head off potential damage.

Then came an announcement from the World Meteorological Organization that a worrisome hole in the earth's protective ozone shield appears to be getting even larger over Antarctica. Such enlargement had been expected because it will take a while for corrective actions already taken by many governments to exert their effect. But the report underscored that the battle to save the ozone layer is not yet safely won.

The U.N.'s global warming report, described by William K. Stevens in the Sept. 10 Times, indicates that man-made global warming is a real phenomenon. It cannot be dismissed as unproved 'liberal claptrap,' as Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, who heads a House environmental subcommittee, has derisively suggested.

For years now scientists have been arguing over whether the emission of 'greenhouse gases,' such as carbon dioxide generated by the burning of fossil fuels, has contributed to a small rise in global temperatures over the past century -- and whether such emissions will drive temperatures even higher in coming decades.","American officials have concluded that the United States will fall short of that goal, but they have embraced the idea of 'joint implementation' as a strategy that could have even greater effect.

The United States has not yet enacted a law allowing utilities to count their pollution reductions abroad against reductions they would otherwise be expected to achieve at home. But many utility executives predict that such a law may be enacted in the years ahead, and are seeking experience in ways to cut emissions abroad.

And American utilities are actively seeking markets in the developing world, from which almost all of the future increase in demand for electric power is likely to come.

The utilities behind the Decin project -- Wisconsin Electric Power Company, a unit of the Wisconsin Energy Corporation; Nipsco Industries of Indiana, and Commonwealth Edison of Illinois, a unit of the Unicom Corporation -- are hoping that their work here will position them for future contracts in the Czech Republic and elsewhere if emissions of pollutants and of gases like carbon dioxide are restricted.

Decin, a town of 55,000 in northern Bohemia, is in the heart of the 'black triangle,' a highly polluted region that includes corners of Poland and the former East Germany as well as the Czech Republic. The incidence of respiratory ailments and malignant tumors in Decin is more than 50 percent higher than in the rest of the Czech Republic, and diseases during pregnancy are four times as frequent.

'These levels would have to qualify us as an environmental disaster area,' said Milan Kunc, 29, the Mayor of Decin, who has been a driving force behind the project. 'We now see the possibility of confronting this problem, and at the same time contributing to the global environment.'

The new 10.6-megawatt plant in Decin is to cost $7 million to build. The Czech Government is paying most of the cost, with the American utilities putting up $600,000 and the Danish Government contributing a similar sum.","Nevertheless, the panel's conclusion marks a watershed in the views of climatologists, who with the notable exception of Dr. James E. Hansen of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York have until now refused to declare publicly that they can discern the signature of the greenhouse effect.

The new consensus, as represented by the intergovernmental panel, seems likely to stimulate more public debate over how seriously the threat of climate change should be taken.

As for the future, the draft summary forecasts an increase in the average global temperature of 1.44 degrees to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100 if there is no further action to curb emissions of greenhouse gases. But that represents only 50 to 70 percent of the eventual warming, it says. These changes would be more rapid than any in the last 10,000 years, the period in which civilization developed, the panel says.

And it says that whatever action is taken in the future, the world still faces a further average temperature increase of 1 to 3.6 degrees.

By comparison, according to varying estimates, the average global temperature is 5 to 9 degrees warmer now than in the last ice age.

While a warmer world could be beneficial in some ways, the draft says, there would be many adverse effects. These include more extreme weather and possibly more intense tropical storms, destruction of some communities by rising seas, damage to and loss of natural ecosystems that cannot adapt rapidly enough, diminished agricultural output in some places and an increase in some tropical diseases.

Experts agree that the average surface temperature of the globe has already risen about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the last century, but there has long been debate over the cause.","The Chinese also are heavy users of such substances as chlorofluorocarbons in aerosols that deplete the ozone layer. Since 1986, Chinese consumption of these ozone-depleting compounds has soared from 3 percent to 18 percent of the world total.

Defenders of China say that global concern about its environmental record is hypocritical: They point out that no one stopped the United States from polluting when it was rapidly industrializing. But environmental experts assert that the United States and other countries adopted tough regulations when air and water pollution began to harm human health and national economies. China, while adopting an extensive set of environmental laws, has not shown that it is prepared to deal with the problems aggressively.

The country invests a meager 0.7 percent of its gross national product in environmental protection. Chinese experts have admitted that at least 2 percent of G.N.P. would be necessary merely to prevent a worsening of water shortages and air pollution.

While reluctant to spend money on global problems, China has sought outside funds and technical assistance. The United States should not succumb to pressure, but it should reinstate China as a member of the U.S.-Asia Environment Partnership, which supports technology transfer in Asia. (China was denied American environmental assistance after the 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square.) The United States should also take advantage of the Chinese request for development assistance.

Japan has already made environmental issues a priority in its dealings with Beijing. For example, any new thermal power plant built in China with Japanese money must be equipped with desulfurization technology. The United States can require similar stipulations to agreements with American companies.","Instead, the American manufacturers called for the Administration to study the potential impact on economic growth, competitiveness and trade flows of any further emission reductions beyond that already agreed to by industrialized countries at the United Nations' Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro three years ago, when they agreed to reduce them to 1990 levels by the year 2000. At the time, the Bush Administration would not agree to those guidelines, but the Clinton Administration has since pledged that the United States would meet them.

'Of particular concern to the members of the Global Climate Coalition is the urgent need for a plan and timetable for a thorough analysis of the potential impacts on economic growth, trade competitiveness and jobs in the U.S. and how they compare to the impact on nations in Asia and Europe that compete with the U.S.,' the letter says.

But it noted with regret that the Administration had warned that efforts to cut the Federal budget deficit make it 'unlikely that money would be available in fiscal year 1996 for adequate analysis.'

The letter to Secretary of State Christopher is signed, among others, by the presidents or chief executives of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, the American Forest and Paper Association, the Chemical Manufacturers Association and the National Mining Association.

'We live in a very competitive world,' said John Shlaes, the coalition's executive director. 'What are presented as environmental issues are really economic and trade issues we do not yet fully understand.'","The original study of the ice cores showed what was taken as evidence of radical 'flickers' in climate in the 20,000 warm years between the last two ice ages, and it was this that the same researchers questioned today.

The present warm period has been relatively stable, but the report of previous wild fluctuations led to concern that they might recur in this one. In such an event, farmers might not have time to adjust to altered growing conditions and coastal cities would have to deal with rapidly rising sea levels.

The revised interpretation was reported both here and in the current issue of Nature. Details of Drilling

One of the drilling projects, known as GRIP, conducted by a consortium of European institutions, began at the summit of the Greenland ice sheet at 10,500 feet above sea level and reached bedrock after extracting 9,938 feet of ice. The bottom layers are believed to have formed from snow that fell 150,000 years ago. The other project, 20 miles to the west, was by a team of American institutions and was known as GISP-2. It reached a similar depth and also bored five feet into the underlying rock.

Comparison of ice from the two holes to a depth of 8,858 feet covering the past 95,000 years, showed the same record of sudden climate changes with astonishing uniformity. But study of the deeper ice shows little conformity between the cores.

To minimize flowing that might distort the ice layers, GRIP was drilled on what is now the summit of the ice sheet, atop the thickest ice in the Northern Hemisphere. It was assumed that the ice would slowly and uniformly flow seaward. GISP-2 was drilled at a site 100 feet lower, but near enough the summit, it was thought, to minimize flow. Hope for the Future

Some of today's speakers said they hoped that layers in deeper sections of the two cores could be still correlated and that ancient climates could be determined by using the varying chemistry of dust in the two cores. Much hope also rests on drilling in Antarctica, particularly at the Russian interior station at Vostok, which rests on ice whose base is estimated to be 500,000 years old. Because precipitation in the Antarctic interior is meager, the annual layers at Vostok are very thin, making for a longer but less detailed record.","To the Editor:

S. Fred Singer, in 'Global Warming Remains Unproved' (letter, Sept. 19), criticizes the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international group of thousands of scientists who analyze data and advise the world's governments of climate change.

Contrary to Mr. Singer's claim, the atmosphere has indeed warmed. Surface temperature data indicate a warming of a little less than one degree Fahrenheit over the past 130 years, and the 10 warmest years in the record have occurred since 1980.

Satellite data, available only since 1979, also show a warming trend at higher altitudes when adjusted to eliminate short-term 'noise' like the cooling effect of recent, unusually large volcanic eruptions.

The climate change panel's 1992 report did not predict a warming of 2.7 degrees to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit 'by the middle of the next century' as Mr. Singer asserts. Rather, it projected a warming of roughly this size for the year 2100.","To the Editor:

Your Sept. 10 front-page article on how the scientific experts who advise countries on changes in the climate now say human activity is causing global warming fails to address the basic question:

What is global warming?

'Experts' notwithstanding, the atmosphere is not warming -- nor has it warmed in the past 16 years, ever since precise global data have become available for the first time from weather satellites.

So what produced this 'important shift of scientific judgment' by the United Nations-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change?

And what has caused its 1995 draft summary -- yet to be approved -- to conclude that what the drafters see as warming in the last few years 'is unlikely to be entirely due to natural causes . . .' -- hardly a ringing confirmation of a human role?

There are no new, startling observations. What's changed is the theoretical projection of future warming, although it's not easy to learn this from the draft report.","Mr. Karl, who has been agnostic on the question of whether greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of fossil fuels are changing the climate, was joined in conducting the study by three other researchers at the data center: Richard W. Knight, Dr. David R. Easterling and Robert G. Quayle. Their report appears in the initial issue of Consequences, a new federally supported, peer-reviewed journal on environmental change published by Saginaw Valley State University in Michigan.

Discussion of the greenhouse effect has usually focused on the question of whether the earth will warm and by how much; scientists believe a doubling of greenhouse gas concentrations would raise the average global temperature by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit. But climatologists have said all along that the most obvious effects, and those that will have the largest impact on people, would be extremes of temperature, precipitation and storminess.

The Federal scientists set out to measure changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. The researchers reasoned that the United States provides an especially clear window on the global situation because its long-term data are so abundant and clear. The scientists also wanted to look at possible effects of global climate change that would be noticed in people's everyday lives.

There were two aspects to the study. In the first, the researchers identified the years in which extremes of heat, cold, drought and wetness occurred. Extremes were defined as the top and bottom 10 percent of the long-term climate record. These indicators were combined into a single index of extremity. The researchers found that since the late 1970's, the index has been about 1.5 percent higher than the average of the previous 65 years. Expressed another way, they said, the parts of the country affected by 'a persistent increase of extreme events,' when added together, equal somewhat more than the area of the state of Indiana.

Similar peaks of extreme weather occurred in the 1930's and 1950's, but the present one has lasted longer, said Mr. Quayle. These recent changes are not large enough and have not persisted long enough for anyone 'to conclude that the climate has systematically changed to a more extreme state,' the researchers wrote.","What Was Known

Years of Research, Little Progress

A big part of the problem is that although experts have been studying clouds for decades, their investigations have been limited to relatively small-scale inquiries in only a few areas of the globe.

They have known that clouds form when water condenses around dust particles or other minute nuclei, and that they are mostly air. ''You almost wouldn't have predicted them,'' says Stephen Schwartz, a cloud expert at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, who explains that they are on the order of one part water to a million parts atmospheric gas.

Scientists have also known that for all their evanescence, clouds are the means by which the oceans and the atmosphere interact, and by which both heat and water are distributed around the globe. Sunlight hitting the ocean causes water to evaporate, which rises into cooler air and forms clouds. It condenses and falls as rain, releasing large amounts of latent heat in the process. This heat is the fundamental energy source driving all the winds of the atmosphere.

And they have known that in one guise, the minute cloud droplets reflect sunlight back into space, helping to keep the planet cool, and that in another, they trap huge amounts of heat in the atmosphere.

Despite this, there was much scientists did not know about how clouds affect the global climate. ''It was a sampling problem,'' said William B. Rossow of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City, who has been analyzing satellite data on cloud characteristics and behavior as part of an international research project. Primarily, he explained, scientists in the past had limited themselves mostly to studies of clouds in the temperate zones and over the continents, where data collection was most feasible in the absence of satellites. ''But we just never saw it on the scale of the whole planet,'' he said.

That is changing. Data collected by satellites and now being analyzed and published, along with the early results of intensive investigations of the workings of important kinds of cloud systems, are starting to provide scientists with the elements they need to put together a coherent picture of cloud behavior.

What's Been Found

Surprising Effects Over the Oceans

By analyzing satellite measurements of the earth's heating as part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Earth Radiation Budget Experiment between 1984 and 1990, Dr. Ramanathan and his colleagues were surprised to find that globally, clouds amplified the greenhouse warming by an unexpectedly large amount - as much as if carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were not merely doubled, but multiplied by 250. But they also found that clouds reflected even more heat from the sun, exerting a net cooling effect on the planet.","Developing countries make essentially a moral argument for requiring more of the richer nations, and sooner. They point out that the richer nations are responsible for most of the carbon dioxide emitted so far and that their emissions per person far outweigh those of third world countries. The United States, for example, is the world's largest source of emissions. As of 1991, the nation's per capita emissions of nearly 20 metric tons a year were almost 10 times those of China.

But that is expected to change dramatically. China, with its huge coal reserves, could well become the world's largest source of emissions in 25 years, according to a new study by Yale University's Center for Environmental Law and Policy. Other developing countries are also expected to increase their share of global emissions, and the United Nations projects that without further controls, they will far surpass the richer nations' combined total some time in the next century.

The Yale study 'shows that the impacts from the developing countries can no longer be ignored as they have been to date and were at Rio,' said Daniel C. Esty, the director of the Yale center and a former Environmental Protection Agency official who was a member of the American negotiating team when the climate treaty was forged.

Representatives of fossil fuel and related industries, whose clients in the rich countries stand to benefit if the responsibility for reducing emissions is spread more widely, have long argued for including the developing countries. They were not thrilled at the outcome in Berlin.

The agreement reached there 'gives the developing countries like China, India and Mexico a free ride,' said John Shlaes, executive director of the Global Climate Coalition, an industry group. 'Without substantial commitments by these emerging large emitters of greenhouse gases, there can be no meaningful climate treaty,' he said.

The United States, which has taken a moderate and deliberate position on what to do about emissions after 2000, has been roundly criticized by environmentalists for what they see as a lack of leadership on the question. After Berlin, Mr. Wirth quipped, 'We can come back and say, 'Ich bin ein reducer.' '

Behind everything lurks the uncertainty about what is really happening to the global climate. Scientists generally agree there is little doubt that the world is warming. The average global temperature increased by about one degree Fahrenheit in the last century, and the rise has become steeper in the last two decades. After a two-year hiatus brought about by the cooling effects of the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, the global average in 1994 again approached the record high of 1990, just as scientists had predicted. The trend continued in the first two months of 1995. Rising temperatures of sea surfaces and an increase in atmospheric water vapor, expected in a warming world, have also been reported lately.","'This paper goes way beyond what has been shown before in determining the sharpness of the correlation between methane and climate change,'' said Ralph Cicerone, chairman of the geosciences department at the University of California at Irvine. ''They have put some hard numbers on theories that atmospheric methane concentrations are strongly correlated with the climate of the earth.''

Recent studies have shown that methane in the atmosphere has nearly doubled, from 350 parts per billion by volume during the ice ages to 650 parts per billion during interglacial periods. The current level is 1,700 parts per billion.

The new study does not yet prove that high levels of carbon dioxide and methane, which are so-called greenhouse gases, cause the earth's temperature to rise, but it does lend credibility to that assumption, Professor Cicerone said.

In recent years many scientists have warned that methane could contribute strongly to global warming because it traps heat in the atmosphere. From 425 million to 675 million tons of methane are emitted each year, and levels are increasing.

Wetlands are the principal natural source, but the gas also arises from forest fires, termites, coal mines, landfills, and the digestive tracts of animals like cattle and goats. Human-induced sources are believed to account for about 60 percent of the methane currently emitted.","Since cutting carbon dioxide emissions would have major economic impact, the idea that the emissions could bring climatic disaster has been disputed by political conservatives and some industry spokesmen. The intergovernmental panel's assessments on the climatic impact of carbon dioxide have also been attacked by scientists who reached contrary conclusions. The panel is preparing a reassessment of the response of climate to the continuing rise in heat-trapping gases, to be completed in about a year.

In the meantime, the group's new report outlines a daunting challenge to parties to the climate treaty as they grapple with the question of stabilizing carbon dioxide at a safe atmospheric level, as the treaty requires.

The new findings are based on a range of computer models of the global carbon cycle, in which recycled carbon moves continuously, over varying periods of time, among animals, plants, microbes, the atmosphere, the oceans and sedimentary rocks. In recent millenniums, scientists say, this flux produced a concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide that was more or less constant at about 280 parts per million. Since the dawn of the industrial age, the level has risen to about 360 parts per million, an increase of 28.5 percent.

In the last century, the average surface temperature of the earth has risen by about 1 degree, but scientists say this warming could as easily have been produced by the climate system's natural fluctuations as by the increase in heat-trapping gases.

Many uncertainties surround the new analysis of emissions and concentrations. The carbon-cycle models differ in their estimates by plus or minus 15 percent, and they include a number of simplifications, assumptions and missing elements. For instance, scientists have long been unable to account for the fate of about 20 percent of the carbon dioxide emitted as a result of human activity. The oceans and the atmosphere take up the bulk. The new report says that some of the remainder is probably being absorbed by the regrowth of forests in the Northern Hemisphere. And a substantial part of the missing fraction may be residing in the deep roots of grasses planted to make way for cattle in South American savannas, according to a report by scientists at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture in Cali, Colombia, appearing in the current issue of the British journal Nature.

In any case, the model studies found that if carbon dioxide emissions were maintained at today's levels, atmospheric concentrations of the gas would increase for at least 200 years, reaching about 500 parts per million -- almost twice the pre-industrial concentration -- by the end of the next century.

The analysis also found that concentrations can be stabilized at any and all levels up to 750 parts per million, about twice today's concentration, only by cutting emissions below 1990 levels. The ultimate stabilization level depends on total accumulated emissions and is unaffected by the schedule on which they are reduced, the report said. But it said higher emissions in earlier decades would require lower ones later. 'You can have a bonanza for a time and burn what you want,' said Dr. Houghton, but 'then you've got to come down with a bang.' In that case, he said, higher emissions in the earlier decades would cause some measure of climate change.","To the Editor:

Astonishingly, the recent story on improved prospects for the coal industry (''Will Coal, the Plentiful Old Standby, Pick Up Speed?'' Aug. 26) fails to mention global climate change, arguably the single most important roadblock in coal's future.

Many scientists now believe that changes in the Earth's atmosphere caused by increased emissions of heat-trapping ''greenhouse gases'' from human activities will alter the climate over the next century, with potentially serious environmental and economic consequences. The most important greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide emitted from the burning of fossil fuels, particularly coal, which contains more carbon than either oil or natural gas.

Utilities in the United States already depend on coal for more than half of all the electric power they produce. Thanks to that dependence, the United States leads the world in emissions of carbon dioxide, and the utility sector leads the United States economy, producing nearly 1.9 billion tons yearly, which is more than seven tons for every American.

We have failed to take action to protect our energy security by finding alternatives to oil over the past decade. As a result, we find ourselves today contemplating war over oil in the Middle East.","Leaders of environmental groups criticized the United States delegation, saying that American negotiators under the direction of John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, had sought since the start of the conference on Feb. 4 to prevent more substantive discussion of potential solutions for global warming.

David D. Doniger, a senior lawyer in Washington for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national environmental group said: 'The largest problem that remains is that the United States is still not committed to targets or a timetable for cutting emissions of carbon dioxide.'

The international conference was the first of four to be held around the world before a meeting to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 to consider a treaty to reduce the threat from global warming.

Many of the delegates meeting here said they had hoped to quickly establish the guidelines for the negotiations and then use the rest of their time in the United States to write a preliminary draft of the final treaty. Their plans were stymied by the American delegation's refusal to consider anything other than procedural issues. U.S. Is Isolated

The negotiating tactics put the United States at odds with almost every other nation represented here, including its closest allies. For instance, early in the conference Canada said it 'enthusiastically supported the development' of a treaty that contained specific limits on emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases, and welcomed schedules for meeting those limits.","The information provided by the three groups is intended to form the basis of further international action to deal with the problem. An international conference will be held in Geneva this November to plan the next steps.

The policy group's recommendations generally parallel the Bush Administration's approach to the problem. The Administration wants to delay specific international action, like mandatory reduction of carbon dioxide and other pollutants, and to focus on more study of the scientific and economic implications of the shift in climate.

European governments are expected to press for a stronger report when the members of the American-led working group meet in Geneva next week to prepare its final report, said an official in the Netherlands Embassy here.

The official said Western European governments were concerned that the policy summary prepared by the United States put more emphasis on uncertainties than was warranted by the findings of subcommittees that did the research for the report. But he said that his government could not comment officially on the report because it was still in draft form. #2 Panels at Odds Daniel Lashof, a global warming expert for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said ''there is a real disconnect'' between the recommendations of the science panel and the draft report by the working group on policy responses. He said the science panel ''made a strong statement about the science and the need for at least a 60 percent reduction in carbon dioxide, while the policy group did not even analyze the policy measures needed to reach that reduction.''

Frederick M. Bernthal, deputy director of the National Science Foundation and chairman of the policy working group, did not respond to several telephone calls over the last two days.","STUDYING a coral reef among the islands of Indonesia, scientists have found further evidence that the sea level was five or six feet higher in the period before the last ice age than it is now.

European and Indonesian scientists examined the reef, which is just off the coast of Sumba Island. The reef formed in a series of terraces, resembling a staircase, with each step representing the growth of the reef between ice ages. By measuring the decay of uranium in samples taken from the reef, the scientists approximated its geological history.

Dr. Ulrich Radtke, a professor of geography at Heinrich-Heine University in Dusseldorf, Germany, said that by understanding how changes in climate affected sea level over the last million years, scientists can better understand how global warming might affect the climate today. The findings were published in the current issue of the journal Nature.

Scientists have been exploring such reefs since the 1960's at sites off the coast of Barbados and Papau, New Guinea. Geological records of glacial cycles have been largely destroyed on land by the action of glaciers. Therefore many scientists have turned to the marine record to analyze changes in climate."
2000s,"SYDNEY — This was a good, if distant, vantage point to view the proceedings in Copenhagen. Good because Australia has one of the highest per capita carbon emissions in the world and has been suffering from an extended drought, probably related to global warming.

Good, too, because, despite those unpleasant facts just days before Copenhagen, the Australian Senate rejected an ambitious emission-trading scheme designed to cut pollution by making emitters pay. Its vote on Dec. 2 proved a fitting precursor to Copenhagen.

The Australian example shows vividly how no amount of horse-trading between developed and developing countries at international summit meetings is going to have much of an impact without prior leadership by wealthy countries at the national level. This is not a moral issue but a practical one, which takes account both of the technical and management capability of advanced countries and the political realities of a world that likes to divide itself into simple 'developed' and 'developing' categories.

It is legitimate to accuse China, India and others of being deliberately obstructive to show off their political muscle, even while they acknowledge the necessity of reductions in carbon emissions. But it does no good at all when advanced democracies are incapable for domestic political reasons of taking decisive unilateral action. In the Australian case, public opinion appears to agree that climate change is a real threat and that emissions-trading is an acceptable way to tackle it. But the legislation has been thwarted by a coalition of opponents — climate-change skeptics, greens who think too much has been surrendered to local coal interests, and others who believe the trading scheme is technically flawed.","COPENHAGEN  On any list of tough sales jobs in American politics, tax increases, higher energy prices and foreign aid would rise to the top.

The worldwide negotiations on curbing climate change involve all three  while Americans suffer 10 percent unemployment. Yet talks here in Copenhagen drew America’s leading Democrats, including President Obama, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, like moths to a flame.

It provided a fitting coda to Mr. Obama’s first year in office. He made policy ambition his hallmark; Congressional Democratic leaders have followed, with historically remarkable early results. But the process has been acrimonious, and all now have sagging poll ratings to prove it.

Perhaps most ambitious is the effort to reshape America’s economy in the name of averting environmental disaster, and to persuade foreign rivals to work together toward that goal.","Whether it’s the manufacturer of the environmentally friendly dishwashing liquid on the kitchen counter or the retailer of the LED light above the bathroom sink, it seems there is scarcely a company that has failed to grasp the moral obligation and economic opportunity that is represented by the green market.

Perhaps nowhere will this be more apparent than at Bright Green, a two-day trade fair on sustainable living in Copenhagen offered by the Confederation of Danish Industry, starting Dec. 12. The trade fair is one of many events on the fringes of the United Nations summit meeting on climate change, known as C.O.P. 15.

The trade fair, which will showcase the latest solutions to climate change, takes its name from the term 'bright green,' which was coined in 2003 by Alex Steffen, a writer and blogger in Seattle. Mr. Steffen used the term to refer to the use of technological progress and social innovation as the routes to sustainable development and climate stability. The term has become a rallying cry for people seeking technological answers to environmental challenges.

'Our message is clear,' said Jens Holst-Nielsen, a senior adviser at the Confederation of Danish Industry. 'We don’t need to sit around and wait for some technological revolution in order to set an ambitious climate goal. Bright Green is a live statement that the solution to the climate problem exists. The technology is ready, here and now.'","The glaciers that have long provided water and electricity to this part of Bolivia are melting and disappearing, victims of global warming, most scientists say.

If the water problems are not solved, El Alto, a poor sister city of La Paz, could perhaps be the first large urban casualty of climate change. A World Bank report concluded last year that climate change would eliminate many glaciers in the Andes within 20 years, threatening the existence of nearly 100 million people.

For the nearly 200 nations trying to hammer out an international climate accord in Copenhagen, the question of how to address the needs of dozens of countries like Bolivia is a central focus of the negotiations and a major obstacle to a treaty.

World leaders have long agreed that rich nations must provide money and technology to help developing nations adapt to problems that, to a large extent, have been created by smokestacks and tailpipes far away. But the specifics of that transfer  which countries will pay, how much and for what kinds of projects  remain contentious.

Last week, a group of the poorest small countries debated whether they would stage a walk-out in Copenhagen if rich nations failed to provide enough money. Todd Stern, the lead negotiator for the United States, while reiterating that the United States would help pay, bridled at the idea that the money was a 'climate debt.' And on Friday, the European Union made an initial pledge to pay $3.5 billion annually for three years to help poor countries cope  though economists project the total cost to be $100 billion or more.","BRUSSELS — European Union leaders agreed on Friday to pay $10.5 billion over the next three years to help poor countries begin tackling the effects of global warming  and to improve the odds of reaching an international climate accord next week at a conference in Copenhagen.

But the developing world is also seeking a commitment from industrial powers to provide long-term financing of more than $100 billion each year by the end of the next decade. European Union leaders left unanswered how much they would give in the longer term.

The push in Brussels, where the European Union is based, came as a group of negotiators in Copenhagen who were convened by the United Nations issued a six-page informal outline of a new climate agreement. The outline sought to pull together a growing stream of conflicting proposals from nations involved in the climate-treaty talks.

The outline calls for wealthy nations to commit themselves to sharp reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions in the next decade, and for all nations to seek jointly to nearly eliminate the emissions by 2050.","Our goal is to change weathercasts into envirocasts,' said Deborah Sliter, a senior vice president of the National Environmental Education Foundation, an American organization that has offered presenters ideas to mention on air, like the blooming of lilacs an average of four days earlier in the spring in the United States than during the 1950s.

Citing a recent study, Ms. Sliter said weather presenters tended to be the most trusted source of climate information for people after scientists, family and friends — hence their huge potential to raise awareness. 'They are stars in their own communities,' she said.

Presenters caution that it may take some time yet for on-air references to climate change to become commonplace during forecasts.

The chief meteorologist of NBC 6 WTVJ in Miami, John Morales, said recent academic research had showed that about half of U.S. weather presenters were actually skeptics of climate change. Of those, about one-third shared the views of broadcasters like John Coleman, who helped found the Weather Channel, an American cable network. He has called global warming 'a scam.'

Other obstacles include links between governments and the media.

In Italy, where Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has voiced skepticism about the need for action on the climate, and where he owns or indirectly controls the majority of television stations, weather professionals often avoid talking about the climate for fear of losing their jobs, said Luca Mercalli, the president of the Italian Meteorological Society and a meteorologist for Rai 3.

Weather professionals acknowledge that they cannot predict weather with much accuracy more than seven to ten days ahead. Moreover, computers have not yet been built that might be able to predict what will happen several years from now in well-defined regions.

Even getting seasonal forecasts right still poses problems.

In April, the Met Office predicted that Britain was 'odds on for a barbecue summer.' But when it turned out very differently, commentators ridiculed the forecasters. The Met Office revised its seasonal forecast in late July in the wake of heavy rains.","In an early indication that the Copenhagen accord failed to satisfy the market, the price of permits to emit greenhouse gases tumbled on Monday. Although they recovered some ground on Tuesday, the initial fall reflected fading hopes for deeper emissions cuts in Europe and for the rapid emergence of a global emissions-trading market in the wake of the summit meeting in Copenhagen.

In contrast to many Europeans, who were unhappy with the deal struck last weekend, Chinese leaders have been pleased by the outcome, which allowed them to walk away with their initial proposal — a 45 percent target for cutting the intensity of carbon emissions by 2020 — almost entirely intact.

At the core of the dispute between China and advanced economies like Britain is the responsibility that Western countries have for putting the vast majority of the gases blamed for global warming in the atmosphere, even as countries like China and India take center-stage as the largest emitters of the future. 'China wants to exert newly found superpower status, and its leaders know that they need to show leadership in cutting emissions,' said Abyd Karmali, the global head of carbon markets for Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

'On the other hand, the Chinese leadership needs to satisfy a domestic constituency that believes the historical burden for emissions has little to do with them, that there is no need to constrain its economic development, and that there is certainly no need to show much deference to other countries,' he said.

The agreement finally patched together in Copenhagen by President Barack Obama and leaders from China, India, Brazil, South Africa late on Friday set a commitment to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 Fahrenheit. The so-called Copenhagen Accord also promised $100 billion dollars in yearly payments by the end of the next decade to poor nations that risk bearing the brunt of the global warming fallout.

But the accord failed to provide a fixed payout plan for the money, and more important for the E.U. and for European industry, it did it not spell out crucial global emissions targets for 2020 or 2050 that would pressure other advanced economies to cut emissions by adopting tools like carbon trading, which already is in use in Europe.

The result was a bitter disappointment for European leaders, who had insisted, by offering to cut their emissions by 30 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels, that they could pry more concessions from China and the United States. In the end, that offer cut no ice with the Americans and the Chinese, who offered nothing new.","BEIJING  Chinese officials, stung by criticism in the West that China had sabotaged a legally binding agreement for reducing greenhouse gases during talks in Copenhagen, fired back on Tuesday, saying that wealthy nations were seeking to sow discord among developing countries in a cynical attempt to avoid reducing their own emissions.

In comments made to the state-run media, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman took umbrage at the assertions made by Ed Miliband, the British secretary of state for energy and climate change, who said that Beijing had thwarted the passage of an ironclad agreement last week.

Mr. Miliband, in an article published Sunday in The Guardian, accused China of scuttling a proposal that would have reduced global emissions by 50 percent by 2050 with developed countries pledging to reduce climate-warming pollution by 80 percent over the same period.

'The last two weeks at times have presented a farcical picture to the public,' he wrote. 'We cannot again allow negotiations on real points of substance to be hijacked in this way.'","Peterborough, England

FOR the many disappointments of the recent climate talks in Copenhagen, there was at least one clear positive outcome, and that was the progress made on a program called Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Forest Degradation. Under this program, key elements of which were agreed on at Copenhagen, developing countries would be compensated for preserving forests, peat soils, swamps and fields that are efficient absorbers of carbon dioxide, the primary heat-trapping gas linked to global warming.

This approach, which takes advantage of the power of nature itself, is an economical way to store large amounts of carbon. But the program is limited in that it includes only those carbon sinks found on land. We now need to look for similar opportunities to curb climate change in the oceans.

Few people may realize it, but in addition to producing most of the oxygen we breathe, the ocean absorbs some 25 percent of current annual carbon dioxide emissions. Half the world’s carbon stocks are held in plankton, mangroves, salt marshes and other marine life. So it is at least as important to preserve this ocean life as it is to preserve forests, to secure its role in helping us adapt to and mitigate climate change.

Sea-grass meadows, for example, which flourish in shallow coastal waters, account for 15 percent of the ocean’s total carbon storage, and underwater forests of kelp store huge amounts of carbon, just as forests do on land. The most efficient natural carbon sink of all is not on land, but in the ocean, in the form of Posidonia oceanica, a species of sea grass that forms vast underwater meadows that wave in the currents just as fields of grass on land sway in the wind.","The Copenhagen conference, which ended without a timetable to reach a binding global agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions, represented a humiliation for European Union leaders seeking to lead global efforts to tackle climate change.

Mr. Sarkozy said he strongly favored the tax, scheduled to go into force on the first day of the new year, as a way to shift France onto a low-carbon path and modify the way the state collects revenue.

The tax was set at 17 euros for each ton of carbon dioxide.

Members of the opposition Socialist party, many of whom said the tax would damage citizens’ purchasing power, said the defeat was a personal one for Mr. Sarkozy. He had cultivated an image of aggressively fighting emissions on the international stage but was unable to put in place workable policies at home.

Members of the French Green party said the defeat would force the government to come forward with a bill that would be more effective in helping to curb France’s contribution to global warming.

A number of Scandinavian countries already have similar taxes, which raise the cost of fuel for motorists and for household heating.","1:03

0:41","The price per metric ton of permits to spew carbon-dioxide into the atmosphere fell by $3.30 on the European Climate Exchange between the first day of the climate summit in Copenhagen and the day after its disappointing conclusion as traders reacted to the failure to reach binding targets for future carbon emissions.

The decline  which put the price of the benchmark futures contract dated December 2010 at $18.20 per ton  reflects the European market’s deflated expectations that the meetings would lead to a treaty to lower emissions ceilings and boost the price of permits.

The depressed price of the emissions permits also suggests that despite years of diplomatic efforts, the real world  where people and businesses buy energy to make things, move things and stay warm  still operates as if people can spew carbon more or less at will.

Consider how much carbon really costs.

After reviewing a series of independent studies, the Environmental Protection Agency concluded last year that the 'social cost' of releasing one more ton of carbon-dioxide into the air, the cost of the environmental damage and other consequences over the next century, was between $40 and $68 in 2007 and would rise to up to $179 in 2040 if we don’t cut emissions soon.","That elsewhere will likely be a much smaller group of nations, roughly 30 countries responsible for 90 percent of global warming emissions. It was these nations that Mr. Obama rallied in a series of dramatic encounters on Friday to finally ink a deal that starts a flow of financing for poor countries to adapt to climate change and sets up a system for major economies to monitor and report their greenhouse gas emissions.

This smaller group of nations will meet periodically to tackle a narrower agenda of issues, like technology sharing or the merging of carbon trading markets, without the chaos and posturing of the United Nations process. A version of this already exists in the 17-nation Major Economies Forum, which has been a model of decorum and progress compared with what the world saw unfold at the climate talks.

The deal worked out in Copenhagen is a political agreement forged by major emitters to curb greenhouse gases, to help developing nations build clean-energy economies and to send money flowing to cushion the effects of climate change on vulnerable states. But even if countries live up to their commitments on emissions, a stark gap remains  measured in tens of billions of tons of projected flows of carbon dioxide  between nations’ combined pledges and what would be required to reliably avert the risks of disruptive changes in rainfall and drought, ecosystems and polar ice cover from global warming, scientists say.

The chances of success substantially hinge on whether Mr. Obama can fulfill his promises to reduce American greenhouse gas emissions and raise tens of billions of dollars to help other countries deal with global warming. That in turn depends in large part on whether Congress takes action on a bill that puts a price on carbon and devotes a large part of the proceeds to foreign aid. And that is no sure thing.

Yvo de Boer, the United Nations official who manages the climate negotiations, said that though the Copenhagen accord was 'politically incredibly significant,' it hardly moved the treaty process from where it was in 2007, when the world’s countries pledged to complete a binding agreement here this year.

'We have a lot of work to do on the road to Mexico,' he said, in a reference to the next climate meeting to be held in Mexico City next year.

Even reaching the tenuous accord in Copenhagen was a tortuous path, culminating in an impassioned debate on the floor of the plenary meeting that lasted into the wee hours of Saturday morning.","It’s a National Embarrassment,’ Biden Says on Gun Violence

Ed Miliband, the British secretary of state for climate and energy, acknowledged Europeans’ disappointment in the talks’ result but said he was 'absolutely not in the blame game.' Rather, he said, negotiating strategies needed to be examined.

Delaying discussion of the toughest issues until the final moments of the conference came close to dooming the chances of an accord, Mr. Miliband said. 'My biggest frustration at this conference is not talking about substance, apart from the last day, frankly,' he said.

Mr. Miliband said the months of jockeying leading up to Copenhagen had resulted in some benefits.

'The process has been a nightmare, but the substance of the last year means you have ambitious targets from lots of countries,' he said.

He noted that Brazil, South Africa, India, China and Japan were among the nations that had proposed limits on their emissions before the talks.

'The success of this process has been the fact that it has concentrated minds and has made all the major players put numbers on the table,' Mr. Miliband said.

But he added: 'I would have preferred a much more comprehensive agreement. I think going forward there are some difficult issues if emerging economies don’t want to be part of a legal treaty — which they obviously don’t — about what is the framework in which you operate. We do want a legal treaty, and we will be campaigning for it, but I think there are some difficult issues there.'","The choice of an appropriate social time discount rate has long been debated. Some very intelligent people have argued that giving future generations less weight than the current generation is 'ethically indefensible.' Other equally intelligent people have argued that weighting generations equally leads to paradoxical and even nonsensical results.

The Stern Review sides with those who believe in a low discount rate, arguing that the only ethical reason to discount future generations is that they might not be there at all -- there could be some cataclysmic event like a comet hitting the earth that wipes out all life. The report assumes that the probability of extinction is 0.1 percent per year. For all intents and purposes, this implies a social rate of discount that is effectively zero, implying almost equal weight to all generations.

The report not only chooses to weigh all generations' welfare almost equally, it also makes an extreme choice when specifying the relationship between consumption and welfare. These choices together imply that a 1 percent reduction in consumption today is desirable if it leads to slightly more than 1 percent increase in the consumption of some future generation, even though, in the model, future generations will be much wealthier than the current generation.

Given these assumptions it is easy to see where the large numbers come from. Unchecked global warming will certainly make future generations worse off to some degree. If we add up these losses over all time using a zero social discount rate, we get a large sum: a dollar a year over a million years is a million dollars.

Mr. Nordhaus examines a model of climate change that is similar to the one used in the Stern Review but with a 3 percent social discount rate that slowly declines to 1 percent in 300 years rather than the 0.1 percent discount rate used in the Stern Review. In his model, the welfare of future generations is given less weight than the current generation's welfare. He finds that preventive measures like a tax on carbon emissions are certainly required. But they are of a much smaller magnitude than those recommended in the report.","The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, an arm of the Organization of American States, has declined to rule on a complaint by native Arctic peoples that global warming caused by gases from the United States violates their right to sustain their traditional ways.

Commuting by train or bus, when that choice is available, will make the biggest difference. Consider the average round trip to work -- 23 miles. In the average sedan, which gets 23 miles to the gallon, that is 250 gallons of gas a year and about 5,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions.

In cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, consumers can help by saving either gasoline or electricity. But as for cutting consumption of oil, saving electricity provides little help, because only 3 percent of electricity comes from burning oil.

That said, there are changes around the house that make a big difference. In many parts of the country, for example, heating a home for a winter takes about as much energy as running a car for a year. In a climate like Boston's, replacing single-pane windows and storm windows with new thermal windows in a two-story, 2,000-square-foot house would save about 100 gallons of heating oil (about two-thirds as much oil as the switch to a 16-mile-per-gallon S.U.V). It would also reduce carbon dioxide production by more than 2,000 pounds. If the heating fuel is natural gas, the savings is about 1,600 pounds.

The next biggest energy user at home -- again, depending on climate -- is the air-conditioner. Replacing a 10-year-old air-conditioner with a new one would save about 871 pounds of carbon dioxide a year, although only a little more than a gallon of oil.","When you think about the growth of human population over the last century or so, it is all too easy to imagine it merely as an increase in the number of humans. But as we multiply, so do all the things associated with us, including our livestock. At present, there are about 1.5 billion cattle and domestic buffalo and about 1.7 billion sheep and goats. With pigs and poultry, they form a critical part of our enormous biological footprint upon this planet.

Just how enormous was not really apparent until the publication of a new report, called 'Livestock’s Long Shadow,' by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

Consider these numbers. Global livestock grazing and feed production use '30 percent of the land surface of the planet.' Livestock  which consume more food than they yield  also compete directly with humans for water. And the drive to expand grazing land destroys more biologically sensitive terrain, rain forests especially, than anything else.

But what is even more striking, and alarming, is that livestock are responsible for about 18 percent of the global warming effect, more than transportation’s contribution. The culprits are methane  the natural result of bovine digestion  and the nitrogen emitted by manure. Deforestation of grazing land adds to the effect.","This cottage industry has the potential to become one of the largest commodity markets in the world,' said Emma Stewart, director of research and development at Business for Social Responsibility, a nonprofit consulting and research organization.

For utilities and manufacturers, the ability to trade credits could take some of the sting out of regulation. 'There is more certainty that we will be living in a carbon-constrained world through some sort of legislative activity, and that helps carbon take on a value,' said Sara S. Kendall, vice president for environment, health and safety for Weyerhaeuser, the forest products company.

That value, in turn, makes it easier to persuade shareholders and directors that it makes sense to invest in research on ways to cut emissions even beyond a mandatory level.

'A market-based trading approach fosters innovation,' said Edwin L. Mongan III, director of energy and environment at DuPont, one of the exchange's 14 founders. 'It gives an incentive to use your best technology to get well below the mandatory targets.'

But while utilities and manufacturers worry about abating the costs of new rules, financial firms are already figuring out the best ways to profit from them.

Natsource, a green-oriented investment firm, has begun hiring environmental economists and regulatory experts to help 'figure out what the regulatory regime will look like, and what sort of abatement projects will make sense from an investment standpoint,' said Jack D. Cogen, its chief executive.

GE Energy Financial Services is already negotiating to invest in projects that keep methane from escaping from landfills and coal mines, and it will take ownership of many of the resulting carbon credits. There are only a few deals in the pipeline now, said Kevin Walsh, the unit's managing director, 'but we want to get in, learn and have a few deals under our belt when regulation comes to the U.S.'","POZNAN, Poland  As ministers from 189 countries gather here in the coal mining regions of Poland to hammer out a new climate treaty, progress is being sorely hampered by the transition under way in American politics, delegates and experts here said.

No one expected a team representing President-elect Barack Obama to attend these meetings  he has said there is but one president at a time, and the United States is still represented here by the Bush administration. But the anticipation of his presidency has left this critical meeting in a bit of limbo.

Mr. Obama has called climate change 'a matter of urgency,' promising to seek legislation to cut greenhouse gas emissions sharply and to increase United States participation in global climate initiatives. But many countries are still waiting to size up Mr. Obama’s actual environmental commitment before making bold moves of their own.

'It has affected the meeting in a fairly significant way,' said Gus Silva-Chavez, a policy expert at the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington, who has been observing the closed negotiations. 'A lot of people think: ‘This is not the time to put our cards on the table. Let’s wait for the new administration. Why agree to anything now?’ '","Along with Jane Mayer of The New Yorker, the other winner of a 2008 John Chancellor Award for sustained achievement in journalism , I spoke with graduate students in journalism at Columbia University (in my tux) on Nov. 19. The school just posted video of that conversation.

The session explored a wide range of issues, including:

1) How to cultivate (and protect) sources deep inside a government under an administration fixated with secrecy.

2) How to explain a century-scale change in the human relationship with the planet in a way that fits into traditional journalism (of course, part of the answer is this blog).

Here’s how I explained (around minute 20) why climate change is not 'the story of our time':



Q. Obviously climate change is the biggest story on your plate right now, but looking ahead what do you see?



A. My coverage has evolved. Climate change is not the story of our time. Climate change is a subset of the story of our time, which is that we are coming of age on a finite planet and only just now recognizing that it is finite. So how we manage infinite aspirations of a species that’s been on this explosive trajectory — not just of population growth but of consumptive appetite — how can we make a transition to a sort of stabilized and still prosperous relationship with the Earth and each other is the story of our time.

And it’s a story about conflict. It’s a story about the fact that there are a billion teenagers on planet earth right now. A hundred thirty years ago there were only a billion people altogether — grandparents, kids. Now there are a billion teenagers and they could just as easily become child soldiers and drug dealers as innovators and the owners of small companies in favelas in Brazil. And little tweaks in their prospects, a little bit of education, a little bit of opportunity, a micro loan or something, something that gets girls into schools, those things — that’s the story of our time. And climate change is like a symptom of the story of our time, meaning our energy choices right now come with a lot of emissions of greenhouse gases and if we don’t have a lot of new [choices] we’re going to have a lot of warming.



I hope you’ll watch it, and post your reactions.



If some statement in particular irks or pleases you, try to indicate its position on the tape by the elapsed time. Columbia will soon post video of my acceptance speech, in which I explore the clash between old journalistic norms and the complex, uncertain nature of these times — when the things we don’t know, some of which we can’t know, are likely as important as what is clear.","CONSERVATIVES don’t support tax increases that are veiled as 'cap and trade' schemes for pollution permits. But offer us a tax swap, and we could become the new administration’s best allies on climate change.

A climate-change bill withered in Congress this summer because families don’t need an enormous, and hidden, tax increase. If the bill’s authors had instead proposed a simple carbon tax coupled with an equal, offsetting reduction in income taxes or payroll taxes, a dynamic new energy security policy could have taken root.

Even if the United States extracts more of its own oil  something it needs to do  it will still have only 3 percent of the world’s known oil reserves, and OPEC will still be the cartel with 70 percent of the world’s known oil reserves. Conventional discoveries and unconventional extractions (like shale oil) would improve our standing somewhat, but OPEC’s easily extracted oil makes its members the undisputed kings of crude.

If they’re the kings, we’re the vassals. As long as national security risks aren’t factored into the cost of gasoline and as long as carbon dioxide can be emitted without penalty, oil will continue to have an advantage over emerging fuels in the marketplace, and we’ll continue our ruinous addiction to it.","In an interview, Dr. Holdren, a 64-year-old physicist and environmental policy professor at Harvard, said he was confident he would not have to fight to be heard. He noted that the position was being restored to the level of assistant to the president, on a par with the national security adviser.

'President-elect Obama has made it absolutely clear that he is making science and technology one of the centerpieces of this administration,' Dr. Holdren said.

With Dr. Holdren, Dr. Steven Chu as energy secretary and Carol M. Browner as a White House coordinator for energy and climate, Mr. Obama has chosen advocates for strong action against greenhouse gases. Each has supported a mix of market mechanisms like a legislated cap on emissions and a push to improve nonpolluting energy technology.

Dr. Holdren will also be co-chairman of the President’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, along with Harold Varmus, the Nobel laureate who heads the Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Eric Lander, who heads the Broad Institute, a Harvard-M.I.T. collaborative for genomics research, and who was a leader in efforts to decipher the human genome.

In an interview, Dr. Varmus said one of their first tasks would be to consider new appointees to the council, known as P-CAST. Dr. Varmus noted that current council members, in a 'dear successors' letter to the incoming group, suggested that it be shrunk to perhaps 20 members from 35 and that the council meet more often with lawmakers and the Office of Management and Budget.","Just at the time that the U.S. is finally re-engaging with the international community on climate, it looks like the E.U.’s leadership is dropping away,' said Joris den Blanken, the European climate and energy director for Greenpeace.

Still, many here took heart that the European Union package did not backslide on previously announced commitments to reduce emissions by 2020 to 20 percent below 1990 levels. Indeed, they said the fights in Brussels demonstrated the flexibility of a so-called cap and trade system and were a preview of struggles to come in the United States. Under such a system, which is planned by the new administration, limits are placed on emissions by companies or industries; and if those limits are exceeded, carbon credits must be purchased from others who have not reached their limit.

'The most important thing is that they were not revisiting their targets,' said Elliot Diringer, vice president of international strategies at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change.

Indeed, the combination of a progress here, a new European Union package and the change of administrations in Washington left many delegates and environmental advocates here echoing the words of the Bellona Foundation, the largest environment group in Norway: 'Now the ball is rolling.'

'The expectations for this meeting weren’t high, but there have been good developments and the E.U. package makes me happy,' said Frederic Hauge, chief of Bellona, noting that the package contains billions of dollars for developing new clean technology. Still, some environmental groups left Poznan unsatisfied. 'Over all we are disappointed,' said Savio Carvalho, of Oxfam Uganda, noting that developed nations seemed too consumed with their own financial troubles to provide genuine assistance to poorer countries.

The conference mostly set out to define the final outlines of a treaty that will be negotiated over the next year, and in that regard 'the meeting got done what was needed,' Mr. Diringer said.

At the same time, battle lines were drawn for the coming year. Under the previous treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, industrialized nations had to commit to emissions reduction targets, while developing nations did not. The United States never ratified the Kyoto Protocol."
